# KPI and Metrics Tracking Dashboard for Omnichannel Communication Assistant

### Tools used : PostgreSQL, Metabase

In this project, my team developed an interactive dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for an omnichannel communication assistant platform. The dashboard aggregates and visualizes data from multiple communication channels, including WhatsApp, email, SMS, and IVR, to provide a comprehensive view of customer interactions and engagement.

Key features include real-time tracking of message delivery success rates, engagement metrics per channel, and usage trends. The dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize channel performance, and improve customer retention by identifying insights across various communication touchpoints. This project demonstrates my ability to create impactful, data-driven solutions for complex, multi-channel environments.

## Dashboard Filters

The dashboard includes three primary filters to help users refine data views and conduct detailed analysis:

**1. Date Range Filter** <br>

**Purpose**: This filter allows users to select a specific time period to view data, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns over a chosen range. <br>
**Usage**: Users can set a custom start and end date to define the time range theyâ€™re interested in. By default, the filter in this example is set from January 1, 2024, to November 15, 2024. <br>
**Impact**: Adjusting the date range provides flexibility in examining data over monthly, quarterly, or yearly spans or any custom period, which is particularly useful for tracking seasonal trends and year-over-year changes. <br>

**2. Channel Filter** <br>

**Purpose**: This filter lets users narrow down the data by specific communication channels (e.g., WhatsApp, email, SMS, IVR). <br>
**Usage**: Selecting a channel filters the data to display only interactions and metrics related to the chosen communication platform. <br>
**Impact**: By isolating a single channel, users can analyze the performance and effectiveness of that channel, comparing engagement metrics and KPIs across different communication platforms to understand which channels are driving the most engagement. <br>

**3. Category Type Filter** <br>

**Purpose**: This filter allows users to view data by specific categories or types within the dataset. Categories may include different types of messages or interactions (e.g., promotional, transactional). <br>
**Usage**: Users can select one or more categories to focus on specific data types, making it easier to distinguish between various types of interactions. <br>
**Impact**: Filtering by category type provides insights into the performance and behavior of different categories, such as evaluating the effectiveness of promotional vs. transactional messages. This level of granularity supports targeted analysis and decision-making. <br>
