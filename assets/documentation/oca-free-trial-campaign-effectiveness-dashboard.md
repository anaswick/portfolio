![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d09d7f45-51b6-4f47-bc1d-0dff26a4587c)

**Purpose** <br>
This heatmap tracks user retention on a day-by-day basis, segmented by cohorts. Each cohort represents users who signed up on a specific date, and the chart shows the percentage of users from each cohort who return each day over a 14-day period. This visualization provides insights into user engagement and retention trends during the early stages of a user's journey.

**Usage** <br>
Cohortday: The leftmost column lists the dates when each cohort (group of users) signed up.
Cohort Size: Indicates the number of users in each cohort.
Day-by-Day Retention: Each subsequent column (day_0 to day_14) shows the percentage of users from each cohort who returned on that specific day. Cells are color-coded, with green representing higher retention and red indicating lower retention.
For example, if a cell shows “50%” in the day_1 column, it means that 50% of users from that cohort returned the day after signing up. This chart enables stakeholders to observe daily retention patterns and identify how quickly engagement drops off for each cohort.

**Impact** <br>
By analyzing cohort retention data, the organization can identify which days experience significant drop-offs and understand the overall retention pattern during the free trial period. This information helps in tailoring engagement strategies, such as sending targeted reminders or offering incentives to encourage users to return. Improving early retention rates can lead to higher conversions from free trial to paid users, as engaged users are more likely to see the value in the service. Ultimately, this data-driven approach to retention enhances user experience, increases the likelihood of long-term retention, and supports sustainable growth.
