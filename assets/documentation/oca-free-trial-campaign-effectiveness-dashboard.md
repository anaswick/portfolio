**Purpose** <br>
This section provides key metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the free trial campaign. The metrics include total account creation, active users on the free trial (segmented by Blast Lite and Interaction Lite), and the conversion rate from free trial to paid users. These metrics help gauge user engagement and the success of the free trial in driving paid conversions.

**Usage** <br>
Total Account Created: Tracks the total number of new accounts created through the free trial campaign, representing initial user acquisition.
Active User Free Trial - Blast Lite: Measures the number of users actively using the "Blast Lite" feature during their trial, indicating engagement with core functionality.
Active User Free Trial - Interaction Lite: Measures active users on the "Interaction Lite" feature, showing how many trial users engage with this aspect of the product.
Free Trial Conversion Rate: Calculates the percentage of free trial users who converted to paid subscriptions, providing insight into the trial’s effectiveness in generating long-term customers.
These metrics allow stakeholders to monitor trial performance across user acquisition, engagement, and conversion.

**Impact** <br>
Understanding these metrics enables the organization to optimize the free trial experience by identifying areas for improvement in user engagement and conversion. By analyzing trends in active usage and conversion rates, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to refine campaign strategies, enhance the user journey, and ultimately increase revenue through successful free-to-paid conversions. This data-driven approach helps align the free trial campaign with broader business objectives, maximizing the return on investment for user acquisition efforts.

**Purpose** <br>
This line chart tracks the daily count of new users registering for the free trial. It provides insights into user acquisition trends, highlighting fluctuations in daily registrations that can indicate the effectiveness of marketing efforts or external factors influencing sign-ups.

**Usage** <br>
The x-axis represents the date, while the y-axis shows the number of new free trial registrations each day. Peaks and dips in the chart reflect days with higher or lower sign-ups, allowing stakeholders to observe daily trends. This information can be used to assess the impact of promotional activities, advertising campaigns, or seasonal variations on trial registrations.

This visualization enables stakeholders to quickly identify spikes or drops in daily registrations, providing valuable context for understanding user acquisition performance over time.

**Impact** <br>
Analyzing daily free trial registrations helps the organization optimize marketing and outreach strategies to increase sign-ups. By identifying patterns in registration trends, stakeholders can adjust campaign timing, target specific periods of high activity, and evaluate the impact of marketing initiatives on user acquisition. This data-driven approach enhances decision-making for user growth strategies and aligns trial sign-up efforts with broader business goals for customer acquisition.

**Purpose** <br>
This bar chart shows the distribution of message blasts sent through different communication channels during the free trial period. It highlights which channels are primarily used to engage users, helping to assess the effectiveness of each channel in reaching trial users.

**Usage** <br>
The x-axis lists the different channels used for message blasts, including WhatsApp Utility (wa_utility), WhatsApp Marketing (wa_marketing), email, and SMS. The y-axis represents the total number of blasts sent. In this chart, WhatsApp Marketing is the predominant channel used, with a significantly higher blast count compared to other channels.

This visualization helps stakeholders quickly understand which channels are most actively utilized for engaging free trial users, providing insight into channel-specific usage.

**Impact** <br>
By analyzing channel distribution for message blasts, the organization can evaluate the effectiveness of each communication channel in driving engagement during the free trial period. This data enables informed decisions on optimizing channel strategies, potentially shifting focus to high-performing channels or exploring underutilized ones. Understanding channel effectiveness supports targeted marketing efforts, enhances user engagement, and helps improve conversion rates from free trial to paid subscriptions.


## Retention Analysis - Daily Cohort

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d09d7f45-51b6-4f47-bc1d-0dff26a4587c)

**Purpose** <br>
This heatmap tracks user retention on a day-by-day basis, segmented by cohorts. Each cohort represents users who signed up on a specific date, and the chart shows the percentage of users from each cohort who return each day over a 14-day period. This visualization provides insights into user engagement and retention trends during the early stages of a user's journey.

**Usage** <br>
Cohortday: The leftmost column lists the dates when each cohort (group of users) signed up.
Cohort Size: Indicates the number of users in each cohort.
Day-by-Day Retention: Each subsequent column (day_0 to day_14) shows the percentage of users from each cohort who returned on that specific day. Cells are color-coded, with green representing higher retention and red indicating lower retention.
For example, if a cell shows “50%” in the day_1 column, it means that 50% of users from that cohort returned the day after signing up. This chart enables stakeholders to observe daily retention patterns and identify how quickly engagement drops off for each cohort.

**Impact** <br>
By analyzing cohort retention data, the organization can identify which days experience significant drop-offs and understand the overall retention pattern during the free trial period. This information helps in tailoring engagement strategies, such as sending targeted reminders or offering incentives to encourage users to return. Improving early retention rates can lead to higher conversions from free trial to paid users, as engaged users are more likely to see the value in the service. Ultimately, this data-driven approach to retention enhances user experience, increases the likelihood of long-term retention, and supports sustainable growth.
