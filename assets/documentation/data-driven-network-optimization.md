# Data Driven Network Optimization 


When I became head of the representative office in April 2017, the area ranked worst nationwide in operational and financial performance. The main issue was poor internet network quality, which significantly affected customer satisfaction and revenue. With limited budget resources, I adopted a data-driven approach to identify problems and prioritize network improvements.

## Challenges

1. Network Utilization: <br>
- The Optical Distribution Points (ODPs), each with 8 slots, were underutilized or overcapacity, leading to inefficient resource allocation. <br>

2. High Complaint Volumes: <br>
- Customer dissatisfaction resulted in numerous complaint tickets with no clear prioritization for resolution. <br>

3. Unserved Demand: <br>
Missed opportunities to capture potential revenue from areas with significant unserved demand. <br>

## Approaches

1. Visualizing the distribution and utilization of ODP throughout the area using Google Earth

The color-coded pins (black, green, yellow, red) indicate the utilization of Optical Distribution Points (ODPs):

- Red (7–8 slots used): Overutilized or nearing full capacity.
- Yellow (5–6 slots used): Moderately utilized.
- Green (1–4 slots used): Underutilized.
- Black (0 slots used): Unused infrastructure.

This visualization clearly identifies areas of overcapacity, inefficiency, or unused network infrastructure.
