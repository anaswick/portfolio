# Data Driven Telecommunication Network Optimization for Better Customer Satisfaction

Faced with poor operational and financial performance due to one of the worst internet network qualities nationwide, I implemented a data-driven approach to optimize network improvements and enhance customer satisfaction. Using tools like spreadsheets and Google Earth, I visualized Optical Distribution Point (ODP) utilization with a color-coded system, mapped customer complaint ticket locations, and overlaid historical unserved demand to identify high-priority areas. 

## Challenges

1. Network Utilization: <br>
- The Optical Distribution Points (ODPs), each with 8 slots, were underutilized or overcapacity, leading to inefficient resource allocation. <br>

2. High Complaint Volumes: <br>
- Customer dissatisfaction resulted in numerous complaint tickets with no clear prioritization for resolution. <br>

3. Unserved Demand: <br>
Missed opportunities to capture potential revenue from areas with significant unserved demand. <br>

## Approaches

**1. Visualizing the distribution and utilization of ODP throughout the area using Google Earth**

The color-coded pins (black, green, yellow, red) indicate the utilization of Optical Distribution Points (ODPs):

- Red (7–8 slots used): Overutilized or nearing full capacity.
- Yellow (5–6 slots used): Moderately utilized.
- Green (1–4 slots used): Underutilized.
- Black (0 slots used): Unused infrastructure.

This visualization clearly identifies areas of overcapacity, inefficiency, or unused network infrastructure.

**2. Mapping Complaint Tickets and Overlaying Unserved Demand**

Mapped customer addresses associated with complaint tickets and overlaid them onto the ODP utilization map to identify problem areas. <br>
Visualized historical unserved demand data and layered it over the previous maps to pinpoint high-potential areas for improvement. <br>

**3. Network Development Prioritization**

Priority area will be focused on areas:
- High complaint volumes.
- Significant unserved demand.
- Sufficient ODP capacity for new customers.

Allocated resources strategically to maximize impact within budget constraints.

## Outcomes

1. Consistent double-digit revenue growth: Achieved over 15% Year-on-Year revenue growth.

2. Fulfillment rate improvement: Increased from 40% to 95% (fulfillment rate is the ratio of served demand to total demand, with a higher percentage indicating better service).
3. Reduced complaint rate: Decreased from 12% to 3% of the total customer base in the area.
