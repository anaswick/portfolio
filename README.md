### Data Driven Telecommunication Network Optimization for Better Customer Satisfaction

Faced with poor operational and financial performance due to one of the worst internet network qualities nationwide, I implemented a data-driven approach to optimize network improvements and enhance customer satisfaction. Using tools like spreadsheets and Google Earth, I visualized Optical Distribution Point (ODP) utilization with a color-coded system, mapped customer complaint ticket locations, and overlaid historical unserved demand to identify high-priority areas. 

**Outcomes :**

1. Consistent double-digit revenue growth: Achieved over 15% Year-on-Year revenue growth.
2. Fulfillment rate improvement: Increased from 40% to 95% (fulfillment rate is the ratio of served demand to total demand, with a higher percentage indicating better service).
3. Reduced complaint rate: Decreased from 12% to 3% of the total customer base in the area.
